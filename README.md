Placement eligibility app
This project is a streamlit app of students and their data. 
It refers to their personal data, skills, placements and their programming practice.
At first, I used a .ipynb file to create the data.
Data was not provided. Instead, it was created using Faker library.
The created data was for 4 tables which was then converted to dataframes.
These dataframes were stored in a database file. It was stored in MySQL workbench.
A connection was established between the file and MySQL workbench.
The tables were created in MySQL and values were inserted into them.
A streamlit file was created in .py file and SQL were written in that file to extract the filtered data.
This project is designed to simplify the filtering process of student data.
