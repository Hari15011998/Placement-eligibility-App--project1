# Placement Eligibility App--Project1
Placement eligibility app
This project is a streamlit app of students and their data. 
It refers to their personal data, skills, placements and their programming practice skills.
Data was not provided. Instead, it was created using Faker library.
First, I used a .ipynb file to create the data.
The created data was framed into 4 tables which was then converted to dataframes.
A connection was established between the file and MySQL workbench.
The dataframes were stored in a database file in MySQL workbench.
The tables were created in MySQL and values were inserted into them.
A streamlit file was created in .py file and SQL queries were written in that file to extract the filtered data.
This project is designed to simplify the filtering process of student placement data.
